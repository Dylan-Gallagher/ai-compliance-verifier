                         <p class="oj-normal">Over the last decade, digital technologies have transformed the economy and society, affecting all sectors of activity and daily life. Data is at the centre of that transformation: data-driven innovation will bring enormous benefits to both Union citizens and the economy, for example by improving and personalising medicine, providing new mobility, and contributing to the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal. In order to make the data-driven economy inclusive for all Union citizens, particular attention must be paid to reducing the digital divide, boosting the participation of women in the data economy and fostering cutting-edge European expertise in the technology sector. The data economy has to be built in a way that enables undertakings, in particular micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as defined in the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC <a id="ntc3-L_2022152EN.01000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2022152EN.01000101-E0003"

In its communication of 19 February 2020 on a European strategy for data (the ‘European strategy for data’), the Commission described the vision of a common European data space, meaning an internal market for data in which data could be used irrespective of its physical storage location in the Union in compliance with applicable law, which, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, could be pivotal for the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
                         <p class="oj-normal">The Commission also called for the free and safe flow of data with third countries, subject to exceptions and restrictions for public security, public order and other legitimate public policy objectives of the Union, in line with international obligations, including on fundamental rights. In order to turn that vision into reality, the Commission proposed establishing domain-specific common European data spaces for data sharing and data pooling. As proposed in the European strategy for data, such common European data spaces could cover areas such as health, mobility, manufacturing, financial services, energy or agriculture, or a combination of such areas, for example energy and climate, as well as thematic areas such as the European Green Deal or European data spaces for public administration or skills. Common European data spaces should make data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (the ‘FAIR data principles’), while ensuring a high level of cybersecurity. Where there is a level playing field in the data economy, undertakings compete on quality of services, and not on the amount of data they control. For the purposes of the design, creation and maintenance of the level playing field in the data economy, sound governance is needed in which relevant stakeholders of a common European data space need to participate and be represented.</p>

This Regulation should aim to develop further the borderless digital internal market and a human-centric, trustworthy and secure data society and economy. Sector-specific Union law can develop, adapt and propose new and complementary elements, depending on the specificities of the sector, such as the Union law envisaged on the European health data space and on access to vehicle data. Moreover, certain sectors of the economy are already regulated by sector-specific Union law, which includes rules relating to the sharing of or access to data across borders or across the Union, for example Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2022152EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2022152EN.01000101-E0004"

Where other authorities function as competent authorities under this Regulation, they should do so without prejudice to the supervisory powers and competences of data protection authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>

That action should be without prejudice to obligations and commitments in the international trade agreements concluded by the Union. A Union-wide governance framework should have the objective of building trust among individuals and undertakings in relation to data access, control, sharing, use and re-use, in particular by establishing appropriate mechanisms for data subjects to know and meaningfully exercise their rights, as well as with regard to the re-use of certain types of data held by the public sector bodies, the provision of services by data intermediation services providers to data subjects, data holders and data users, as well as the collection and processing of data made available for altruistic purposes by natural and legal persons. In particular, more transparency regarding the purpose of data use and conditions under which data is stored by undertakings can help increase trust.</p>

Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and sector-specific Union law ensure that the public sector bodies make more of the data they produce easily available for use and re-use. However, certain categories of data, such as commercially confidential data, data that are subject to statistical confidentiality and data protected by intellectual property rights of third parties, including trade secrets and personal data, in public databases are often not made available, not even for research or innovative activities in the public interest, despite such availability being possible in accordance with the applicable Union law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directives 2002/58/EC and (EU) 2016/680. Due to the sensitivity of such data, certain technical and legal procedural requirements must be met before they are made available, not least in order to ensure the respect of rights others have over such data or to limit the negative impact on fundamental rights, the principle of non-discrimination and data protection. The fulfilment of such requirements is usually time- and knowledge-intensive. This has led to the insufficient use of such data. While some Member States are establishing structures, processes or legislation to facilitate that type of re-use, this is not the case across the Union. In order to facilitate the use of data for European research and innovation by private and public entities, clear conditions for access to and use of such data are needed across the Union.</p>

Member States should provide support to public sector bodies to make optimal use of such techniques, thus making as much data as possible available for sharing. The application of such techniques, together with comprehensive data protection impact assessments and other safeguards, can contribute to more safety in the use and re-use of personal data and should ensure the safe re-use of commercially confidential business data for research, innovation and statistical purposes. In many cases the application of such techniques, impact assessments and other safeguards implies that data can be used and re-used only in a secure processing environment that is provided or controlled by the public sector body.

Those conditions should be non-discriminatory, transparent, proportionate and objectively justified, while not restricting competition, with a specific focus on promoting access to such data by SMEs and start-ups. The conditions for re-use should be designed in a manner promoting scientific research so that, for example, privileging scientific research should, as a rule, be considered to be non-discriminatory. Public sector bodies allowing re-use should have in place the technical means necessary to ensure the protection of rights and interests of third parties and should be empowered to request the necessary information from the re-user. Conditions attached to the re-use of data should be limited to what is necessary to preserve the rights and interests of third parties in the data and the integrity of the information technology and communication systems of the public sector bodies. Public sector bodies should apply conditions which best serve the interests of the re-user without leading to a disproportionate burden on the public sector bodies. Conditions attached to the re-use of data should be designed to ensure effective safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. Before transmission, personal data should be anonymised, in order not to allow the identification of the data subjects, and data containing commercially confidential information should be modified in such a way that no confidential information is disclosed. Where the provision of anonymised or modified data would not respond to the needs of the re-user, subject to fulfilling any requirements to carry out a data protection impact assessment and consult the supervisory authority pursuant to Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and where the risks to the rights and interests of data subjects have been found to be minimal, on-premise or remote re-use of the data within a secure processing environment could be allowed.</p>
                         <p class="oj-normal">This could be a suitable arrangement for the re-use of pseudonymised data. Data analyses in such secure processing environments should be supervised by the public sector body, so as to protect the rights and interests of third parties. In particular, personal data should be transmitted to a third party for re-use only where a legal basis under data protection law allows such transmission. Non-personal data should be transmitted only where there is no reason to believe that the combination of non-personal data sets would lead to the identification of data subjects. This should also apply to pseudonymised data which retain their status as personal data. In the event of the reidentification of data subjects, an obligation to notify such a data breach to the public sector body should apply in addition to an obligation to notify such a data breach to a supervisory authority and to the data subject in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Where relevant, the public sector bodies should facilitate the re-use of data on the basis of the consent of data subjects or the permission of data holders on the re-use of data pertaining to them through adequate technical means. In that respect, the public sector body should make best efforts to provide assistance to potential re-users in seeking such consent or permission by establishing technical mechanisms that permit transmitting requests for consent or permission from re-users, where practically feasible. No contact information should be given that allows re-users to contact data subjects or data holders directly. Where the public sector body transmits a request for consent or permission, it should ensure that the data subject or data holder is clearly informed of the possibility to refuse consent or permission.</p>

Such appropriate safeguards should include a requirement that the public sector body transmit protected data to a re-user only if that re-user makes contractual commitments in the interest of the protection of the data. A re-user that intends to transfer the protected data to a third country should comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation even after the data has been transferred to the third country.

To that end, the Commission should be able to declare, by means of implementing acts, where justified because of the substantial number of requests across the Union concerning the re-use of non-personal data in specific third countries, that a third country provides a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that provided by Union law. The Commission should assess the necessity of such implementing acts on the basis of information provided by the Member States through the European Data Innovation Board. Such implementing acts would reassure public sector bodies that re-use of data held by public sector bodies in the third country concerned would not compromise the protected nature of that data. The assessment of the level of protection afforded in the third country concerned should, in particular, take into consideration the relevant general and sectoral law, including on public security, defence, national security and criminal law, concerning access to and protection of non-personal data, any access by the public sector bodies of that third country to the data transferred, the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the legal regime ensuring access to such data, the third country’s international commitments regarding the protection of data, or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems.</p>

Such safeguards should therefore include the availability of enforceable rights and of effective legal remedies. Such implementing acts should be without prejudice to any legal obligation or contractual arrangements already undertaken by a re-user in the interest of the protection of non-personal data, in particular industrial data, and to the right of public sector bodies to oblige re-users to comply with conditions for re-use, in accordance with this Regulation.</p>

Decisions and judgments of third-country courts or tribunals or decisions of third-country administrative authorities requiring such transfer of or access to non-personal data should be enforceable where they are based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. In some cases, situations may arise where the obligation to transfer or provide access to non-personal data arising from a third country law conflicts with a competing obligation to protect such data under Union or national law, in particular with regard to the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual or of the fundamental interests of a Member State related to national security or defence, as well as the protection of commercially sensitive data and the protection of intellectual property rights, including contractual undertakings regarding confidentiality in accordance with such law. In the absence of international agreements regulating such matters, the transfer of or access to non-personal data should be allowed only if, in particular, it has been verified that the third-country’s legal system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision or judgment to be set out, that the decision or judgment is specific in character, and that the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent third-country court or tribunal, which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data.</p>

For example, in the health domain, certain datasets held by actors in the public health system, such as public hospitals, could be identified as highly sensitive health data. Other relevant sectors include transport, energy, environment and finance. In order to ensure harmonised practices across the Union, such types of highly sensitive non-personal public data should be defined by Union law, for example in the context of the European health data space or other sectoral law. Those conditions attached to the transfer of such data to third countries should be laid down in delegated acts. Conditions should be proportionate, non-discriminatory and necessary to protect legitimate Union public policy objectives identified, such as the protection of public health, safety, the environment, public morality, consumer protection, privacy and personal data protection. The conditions should correspond to the risks identified in relation to the sensitivity of such data, including in terms of the risk of the re-identification of individuals. Such conditions could include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements, such as the requirement to use a secure processing environment, limitations with regard to the re-use of data in third countries or categories of persons entitled to transfer such data to third countries or to access the data in the third country. In exceptional cases such conditions could also include restrictions to the transfer of the data to third countries to protect the public interest.</p>

The single information point should be able to rely on automated means where it transmits enquiries or requests for re-use. Sufficient human oversight should be ensured in the transmission process. For that purpose existing practical arrangements such as open data portals could be used. The single information point should have an asset list containing an overview of all available data resources including, where relevant, those data resources that are available at sectoral, regional or local information points, with relevant information describing the available data. In addition, Member States should designate, establish or facilitate the establishment of competent bodies to support the activities of public sector bodies allowing re-use of certain categories of protected data. Their tasks may include granting access to data, where mandated under sectoral Union or national law. Those competent bodies should provide assistance to public sector bodies with state-of-the-art techniques, including on how to best structure and store data to make data easily accessible, in particular through application programming interfaces, as well as make data interoperable, transferable and searchable, taking into account best practices for data processing, as well as any existing regulatory and technical standards and secure data processing environments, which allow data analysis in a manner that preserves the privacy of the information.</p>

The competent bodies should not have a supervisory function, which is reserved for supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Without prejudice to the supervisory powers of data protection authorities, data processing should be carried out under the responsibility of the public sector body responsible for the register containing the data, which remains a data controller as defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 insofar as personal data are concerned. Member States should be able to have one or more competent bodies, which could act in different sectors. The internal services of public sector bodies could also act as competent bodies. A competent body could be a public sector body assisting other public sector bodies in allowing re-use of data, where relevant, or a public sector body allowing re-use itself.

Specialised data intermediation services that are independent from data subjects, data holders and data users could have a facilitating role in the emergence of new data-driven ecosystems independent from any player with a significant degree of market power, while allowing non-discriminatory access to the data economy for undertakings of all sizes, in particular SMEs and start-ups with limited financial, legal or administrative means. This will be particularly important in the context of the establishment of common European data spaces, namely purpose- or sector-specific or cross-sectoral interoperable frameworks of common standards and practices to share or jointly process data for, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, the development of new products and services, scientific research or civil society initiatives. Data intermediation services could include bilateral or multilateral sharing of data or the creation of platforms or databases enabling the sharing or joint use of data, as well as the establishment of specific infrastructure for the interconnection of data subjects and data holders with data users.</p>

Examples of data intermediation services include data marketplaces on which undertakings could make data available to others, orchestrators of data sharing ecosystems that are open to all interested parties, for instance in the context of common European data spaces, as well as data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such data pools to all interested parties in a manner that all participants that contribute to the data pools would receive a reward for their contribution.</p>

                         <p class="oj-normal">A specific category of data intermediation services includes providers of services that offer their services to data subjects. Such data intermediation services providers seek to enhance the agency of data subjects, and in particular individuals’ control over data relating to them. Such providers would assist individuals in exercising their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular giving and withdrawing their consent to data processing, the right of access to their own data, the right to the rectification of inaccurate personal data, the right of erasure or right ‘to be forgotten’, the right to restrict processing and the right to data portability, which allows data subjects to move their personal data from one data controller to the other. In that context, it is important that the business model of such providers ensures that there are no misaligned incentives that encourage individuals to use such services to make more data relating to them available for processing than would be in their interest. This could include advising individuals on the possible uses of their data and making due diligence checks on data users before allowing them to contact data subjects, in order to avoid fraudulent practices. In certain situations, it could be desirable to collate actual data within a personal data space so that processing can happen within that space without personal data being transmitted to third parties in order to maximise the protection of personal data and privacy. Such personal data spaces could contain static personal data such as name, address or date of birth as well as dynamic data that an individual generates through, for example, the use of an online service or an object connected to the Internet of Things. They could also be used to store verified identity information such as passport numbers or social security information, as well as credentials such as driving licences, diplomas or bank account information.</p>

In that context it is important to acknowledge that the rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are personal rights of the data subject and that data subjects cannot waive such rights. Data cooperatives could also provide a useful means for one-person undertakings and SMEs which, in terms of knowledge of data sharing, are often comparable to individuals.</p>

                         <p class="oj-normal">In order to increase trust in such data intermediation services, in particular related to the use of data and compliance with the conditions imposed by data subjects and data holders, it is necessary to create a Union-level regulatory framework which establishes highly harmonised requirements related to the trustworthy provision of such data intermediation services, and which is implemented by the competent authorities. That framework will contribute to ensuring that data subjects and data holders, as well as data users, have better control over access to and use of their data, in accordance with Union law. The Commission could also encourage and facilitate the development of codes of conduct at Union level, involving relevant stakeholders, in particular on interoperability. Both in situations where data sharing occurs in a business-to-business context and where it occurs in a business-to-consumer context, data intermediation services providers should offer a novel, ‘European’ way of data governance, by providing a separation in the data economy between data provision, intermediation and use. Data intermediation services providers could also make available specific technical infrastructure for the interconnection of data subjects and data holders with data users. In that regard, it is of particular importance to shape that infrastructure in such a way that SMEs and start-ups encounter no technical or other barriers to their participation in the data economy.</p>

Those tools and services should be used only at the explicit request or approval of the data holder or data subject and third-party tools offered in that context should not use data for other purposes. At the same time, data intermediation services providers should be allowed to adapt the data exchanged in order to improve the usability of the data by the data user where the data user so desires, or to improve interoperability by, for example, converting the data into specific formats.</p>

                         <p class="oj-normal">It is important to enable a competitive environment for data sharing. A key element by which to increase the trust and control of data holders, data subjects and data users in data intermediation services is the neutrality of data intermediation services providers with regard to the data exchanged between data holders or data subjects and data users. It is therefore necessary that data intermediation services providers act only as intermediaries in the transactions, and do not use the data exchanged for any other purpose. The commercial terms, including pricing, for the provision of data intermediation services should not be dependent on whether a potential data holder or data user is using other services, including storage, analytics, artificial intelligence or other data-based applications, provided by the same data intermediation services provider or by a related entity, and if so to what degree the data holder or data user uses such other services. This will also require structural separation between the data intermediation service and any other services provided, so as to avoid conflicts of interest. This means that the data intermediation service should be provided through a legal person that is separate from the other activities of that data intermediation services provider. However, the data intermediation services providers should be able to use the data provided by the data holder for the improvement of their data intermediation services.</p>
                         <p class="oj-normal">Data intermediation services providers should be able to put at the disposal of data holders, data subjects or data users their own or third-party tools for the purpose of facilitating the exchange of data, for example tools for the conversion or curation of data only at the explicit request or approval of the data subject or data holder. The third-party tools offered in that context should not use data for purposes other than those related to data intermediation services. Data intermediation services providers that intermediate the exchange of data between individuals as data subjects and legal persons as data users should, in addition, bear fiduciary duty towards the individuals, to ensure that they act in the best interest of the data subjects. Questions of liability for all material and immaterial damage and detriment resulting from any conduct of the data intermediation services provider could be addressed in the relevant contract, on the basis of national liability regimes.</p>

Where a data intermediation services provider not established in the Union offers services within the Union, it should designate a legal representative. The designation of a legal representative in such cases is necessary, given that such data intermediation services providers handle personal data as well as commercially confidential data, which necessitates the close monitoring of the compliance of data intermediation services providers with this Regulation. In order to determine whether such a data intermediation services provider is offering services within the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the data intermediation services provider is planning to offer services to persons in one or more Member States. The mere accessibility in the Union of the website or of an email address and other contact details of the data intermediation services provider, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the data intermediation services provider is established, should be considered to be insufficient to ascertain such an intention. However, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering services in that language, or the mentioning of users who are in the Union, could make it apparent that the data intermediation services provider is planning to offer services within the Union.</p>

Such objectives would include healthcare, combating climate change, improving mobility, facilitating the development, production and dissemination of official statistics, improving the provision of public services, or public policy making. Support to scientific research should also be considered to be an objective of general interest. This Regulation should aim to contribute to the emergence of sufficiently-sized data pools made available on the basis of data altruism in order to enable data analytics and machine learning, including across the Union. In order to achieve that objective, Member States should be able to have in place organisational or technical arrangements, or both, which would facilitate data altruism. Such arrangements could include the availability of easily useable tools for data subjects or data holders for giving consent or permission for the altruistic use of their data, the organisation of awareness campaigns, or a structured exchange between competent authorities on how public policies, such as improving traffic, public health and combating climate change, benefit from data altruism. To that end, Member States should be able to establish national policies for data altruism. Data subjects should be able to receive compensation related only to the costs they incur when making their data available for objectives of general interest.</p>

Registration in a Member State would be valid across the Union and is expected to facilitate cross-border data use within the Union and the emergence of data pools covering several Member States. Data holders could give permission to the processing of their non-personal data for a range of purposes not established at the moment of giving the permission. The compliance of such recognised data altruism organisations with a set of requirements as laid down in this Regulation should bring trust that the data made available for altruistic purposes is serving an objective of general interest. Such trust should result in particular from having a place of establishment or a legal representative within the Union, as well as from the requirement that recognised data altruism organisations are not-for-profit organisations, from transparency requirements and from specific safeguards in place to protect rights and interests of data subjects and undertakings.</p>
                         <p class="oj-normal">Further safeguards should include making it possible to process relevant data within a secure processing environment operated by the recognised data altruism organisations, oversight mechanisms such as ethics councils or boards, including representatives from civil society to ensure that the data controller maintains high standards of scientific ethics and protection of fundamental rights, effective and clearly communicated technical means to withdraw or modify consent at any moment, on the basis of the information obligations of data processors under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as means for data subjects to stay informed about the use of data they made available. Registration as a recognised data altruism organisation should not be a precondition for exercising data altruism activities. The Commission should, by means of delegated acts, prepare a rulebook in close cooperation with data altruism organisations and relevant stakeholders. Compliance with that rulebook should be a requirement for registration as a recognised data altruism organisation.</p>

Work on technical standardisation could include the identification of priorities for the development of standards and establishing and maintaining a set of technical and legal standards for transmitting data between two processing environments that allows data spaces to be organised, in particular clarifying and distinguishing which standards and practices are cross-sectoral and which are sectoral. The European Data Innovation Board should cooperate with sectoral bodies, networks or expert groups, or other cross-sectoral organisations dealing with the re-use of data. Regarding data altruism, the European Data Innovation Board should assist the Commission in the development of the data altruism consent form, after consulting the European Data Protection Board. By proposing guidelines on common European data spaces, the European Data Innovation Board should support the development of a functioning European data economy on the basis of those data spaces, as set out in the European strategy for data.</p>
